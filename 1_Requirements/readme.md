4x4 Keypad_interface
================

Introduction
------------
A 4x4 Keypad interfacing and displaying the output (Numbers) to BCD 7-segment using the AVR toolchain without the Arduino IDE.

Hardware
--------
* USB Type A to Type B cable.
* Arduino Uno with the Atmel ATmega328p microcontroller.
* BCD 7-segment
* 16x2 LCD

Installation
------------
You will need to have the AVR toolchain installed on your system. This includes:
* avr-gcc
* avr-libc
* avrdude

# Swot Analysis
## STRENGTH:
*  It hepls in interfacing and displaying the output (Numbers) to BCD 7-segment using the AVR toolchain without the Arduino IDE.
## WEAKNESS:
* The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.
* Complicated to operate.
* Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.
* Risk of computer virus.

## OPPORTUNITIES:
Apart from those informations that are mentioned above in the objectives, you can also use your ideas how to take this project to next level by adding more informations like:
Display all the books that are available, display highest price books etc. 

## THREATS:
 * inadequacy of infrastructure and hardware.
 * Problems in the software.

# 4W's and 1'H
## Why:
The interface is user-friendly and simple to navigate.
## Where:
It can be can be accessed from anywhere.
## Who:
It can be used by any person.
## When:
It can be used at anytime depending upon the person's perferences.
## How:
By entering the details you want to know.
